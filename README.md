# NYU Tandon's [OSIRIS Lab](http://osiris.cyber.nyu.edu/)'s [Hack Night](http://isislab.github.io/Hack-Night/)
Developed from the materials of NYU Tandon's old Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Analysis course, Hack Night is a sobering introduction to offensive security. A lot of complex technical content is covered very quickly as students are introduced to a wide variety of complex and immersive topics over thirteen weeks.

Hack Night culminates in a practical application of the skills and techniques taught, students complete a research project inspired by one of the lectures or exercise materials. By the end of the course, each student is expected to have a good understanding of all topics and a mastery of at least one topic.

*Due to the involved nature of this course, we recommend students attend Hack Night in person.*

~~## Week 2: Source Code Auditing, Part 1~~
This session will cover Code Auditing. Code Auditing an application is the process of analyzing application code (in source or binary form) to uncover vulnerabilities that attackers
might exploit. By going through this process, you can identify and close security holes that would otherwise put sensitive data and business resources at unnecessary risk.
Topics that will be covered are Identifying Architectural, Implementation and Operational vulnerabilities.

### Lecture Materials

~~## Week 3: Source Code Auditing, Part 2~~
This week we will continue with the final video on Code Auditing, and provide you with 2 more applications that are intentionally vulnerable. Your job is to audit the source code and find vulnerabilities in them. Test
the skills that you have learned last week to efficiently go over the process of auditing applications.

### Lecture Materials
1. [Code Auditing 102](http://vimeo.com/29702192/) [[slides](https://github.com/isislab/Hack-Night/blob/master/2014-Fall/slides/code_audits_2_fall2011.pdf?raw=true)]

### Workshop Materials

This network service simulates a text-based terminal application. The general purpose of the application is to act as a "news server" or text file service. These are two types of users: regular and administrator. Administrators can add users and execute back-end system commands. Users can view and contribute articles (aka text files). Assume the application runs on Linux and is compiled with gcc.
2. [Siberia Crimeware Pack](https://github.com/isislab/Hack-Night/blob/master/2014-Fall/workshops/week3/siberia.zip?raw=true) (Password: infected)
The Siberia kit contains live exploit code and will likely set off AV, however none of the exploit code is in a state where it would be harmful to your computer. In addition to all of the vulnerabilites have been patched years ago, the exploits in Siberia need to be interpreted by PHP and read by your browser for them to have any effect. You can safely disable or create exceptions in your AV for this exercise or place the Siberia files inside a VM.

## Week 6: Reverse Engineering, Part 1
This session is about Reverse Engineering.  Most of the software we use everyday is closed source. You don't have the liberty to look at the source code, at this point we need to analyze the available compiled binary. Reversing a binary is no easy task but can be done with the proper methodology and the right tools. This is exactly what two of world's best reverse engineers are going to teach you.

### Lecture Videos

### Workshop Materials
In this section we will go through the basic idea of a binary and how your source code is converted into an executable form. We will then look at the assembly language used by executable programs and develop our own low level programs. We will write simple assembly language programs and teach the basic skills needed to understand more complex assembly language uses.

## Week 10: Exploitation, Part 1
In this week's session, we will go over some advanced concepts related to computer security. Dino Dai Zovi will go over various memory errors that an application can cause often leading to catastrophic results. Topics that will be covered are various memory errors like buffer overflows, uninitialized variables, use after free etc. and how we can use them to take control of an application. We will also look at exploitation mitigation that your current OS implements, it's not 1988 anymore. Finally, we will look at some techniques used to bypass modern mitigations.

## Week 11: Exploitation, Part 2
Picking up from the last session, we will finish watching Dino Dai Zovi's lecture and do a live exploitation of a vulnerable program. We will go through all the steps that Dino explained in his lecture to write a control flow hijacking exploit and take over the program. Once we are done with 1990's style exploitation, we will re-compile the program with modern mitigation technologies and look at various techniques used to bypass these mitigation's.

2. [Exploit-Exercises](http://exploit-exercises.com/)


## Week 12: Post-Exploitation
In this week, we will cover post-exploitation. Post-exploitation is the stage in the intrusion kill chain wherein the attacker uses persistence techniques after the victim's system is compromised to maintain his/her presence on the machine. In addition the attacker also wants his presence to be hidden, this includes evading antivirus software, covering his/her tracks, etc. We will look at various techniques used by attackers to achieve the aforementioned goals.

### Lecture Material
1. [Post Exploitation](http://vimeo.com/33344191)

### Workshop Material
As shown in the lecture video, setup two VM’s. One VM will have metasploit running, backtrack is preferred and the other machine will be a Windows box. Preferred, win xp professional or win 7 professional.
Use the psexec module available in metasploit to gain access to the Windows box. Once, you have a meterpreter session available, apply different techniques demonstrated in the lecture like getting the password hash of Administrator, so that you can re-login as Administrator which gives you elevated privileges.

Having a meterpreter session open isn’t necessarily good enough. For instance, run cmd.exe in windows box; get back to your meterpreter session and find the pid of cmd.exe using “ps” command. Once you are able to figure out the pid, use the migrate command to switch to that process. Now, close the command prompt in the windows box. Do you still have the session open? What do you think a stable process might be to migrate?

If you have found the stable process that you as an attacker want to migrate to, chances are your persistence is good. Although, this may not be the case if the victim restarts his machine. What do you think a better approach would be to keep your connection persistent, even after several reboots? Try to use this method and see for yourself, if you have a persistent connection or not.

## Week 13: Application Security
In this, the last session of Hack Night. We will be going over Fuzzing and later have a short discussion on what you can do to continue improving your skills. Fuzzing is a black box software testing technique, which consists of finding implementation bugs by manipulating input data sent to an application automatically. We will go over different types of fuzzing, various methods used for fuzzing, and finally the process of "smart" fuzzing.
